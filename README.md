# Satria Audria Sakti - Data Analyst Portofolio

## About

<p align=justify>Hello everyone, my name is Satria! I am a fresh graduate in Digital Business with a solid foundation in data and marketing. One of my passions is uncovering meaningful insights from data, especially in marketing data that can be leveraged for customer segmentation or understanding customer behavior. I enjoy finding answers through data, analyzing metrics like revenue or sales figures to address stakeholder inquiries and fulfill KPI requirements. </p>

<p align=justify>Throughout my studies, I developed a diverse skill set, including online product marketing (digital marketing), data analysis to extract insights, and further data processing with automated computations using machine learning. With these skills, I am confident in my ability to become a data specialist, supported by a fundamental knowledge of digital marketing that allows for deeper data analysis and insight generation.</p>
